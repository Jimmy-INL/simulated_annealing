# Hyperparameter Tuning using Simulated Annealing

Models with high number of hyperparameters usually can be used to solve a wide variety of problems owing to the flexibility they offer. One such model that is used often is XGBoost. XGBoost has more than 15 parameters that can be tuned and these hyperparameters dictate the performance of the model. While some of these parameters are more important than others, tuning
